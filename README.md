# Tic-Tac-Toe

It's a basic tic tac toe project but made using the module pattern , that's it .

### ground rules for future revision of this pattern

- self contained module
  - everything to do with my module has to stay in the module
  - no global variables
  - if a module is doing so mush then split it up
- separation of concerns
- DRY
- efficient dom usage
- no memory leaks
  - all events can be unbound

Notes to self :

1. No Draw/Tie Detection
2. No Input Validation on tiles
